# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm cinna.
Cinna, Jam, otherwise James - I'm a 17 year old programmer and digital artist. Welcome to my Github page!

This repos is where I'll keep some personal projects of mine, which I've either worked on at school or in my own time. Feel free to have a look around! What I do here is mostly for fun and not serious as of yet, so feel free to take a look around.

I code in python and C#, planning on trying JS for backend webdev on the side. My personal projects (like the ones I'll put here) are mostly in python. I'll have another markdown file which will have a very rough to-do list (?) where I'll throw my ideas for random projects that I want to take a crack at in the future.

If you want to contact me,
- I'm on discord: @cinnam_n
- You can send me an email: j4zzab@gmail.com
